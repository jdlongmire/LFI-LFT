# LFI-LFT
A repository for the Logic Field Interpretation (LFI) and Logic Field Theory (LFT), innovative frameworks redefining quantum mechanics through logical constraints.

Authored by James D. (JD) Longmire, Jr., LFI posits that quantum phenomena—entanglement, superposition, measurement—emerge from the Three Fundamental Laws of Logic (3FLL) via a Universal Logic Field (ULF), formalized as PR = L(S). LFT extends this into a predictive theory with the Axiom of Finite Physical Realization (AFPR), introducing a resolution parameter ε ~ 10^-5 to forecast a CHSH Bell inequality shift (S ≈ 2.8288).

This project includes:
- LFI Manuscript: Full documentation of the interpretive framework (2025).
- LFT Simulations: Monte Carlo code for CHSH predictions (10^9 trials, scalable to 10^12).
- Experimental Proposals: Designs for testing LFT’s falsifiable predictions.
- Supporting Materials: References, derivations, and philosophical notes.

Aimed at preserving locality while resolving quantum paradoxes, this work bridges logic, information, and physics. Contributions, critiques, and experimental collaborations welcome!
